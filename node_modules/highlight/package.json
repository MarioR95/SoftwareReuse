  "readme": "DEPRECATION NOTICE\n==================\n\nThis project is deprecated in favor of [isagalaev/highlight.js](https://github.com/isagalaev/highlight.js). I never created the parser myself, the module was created in the early days of node as a wrapper for an existing browser based parser [highlight.js](http://softwaremaniacs.org/soft/highlight/en/) so if you are using this module and have problems with the parsing logic, I can't help you much as I'm not familiar with the inner details.\n\nPull requests are still welcomed - if you find a bug and fix it, then I'll pull the change in but I won't be fixing the bugs myself. Sorry for that.\n\nhighlight\n==============\n\n**highlight** for node.js is based on [highlight.js](http://softwaremaniacs.org/soft/highlight/en/) parser and is meant to highlight code syntax in languages that are not known beforehand (*highlight.js* detects the used language automatically). This is especially important for pages in Markdown format - there's no easy way to know which language is actually used.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nUse `npm` package manager\n\n    npm install highlight\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nInclude syntax highlighter\n\n    var hl = require(\"highlight\").Highlight;\n    \nhighlight code\n\n    html = hl(\"for(var i=0;i<10;i++)alert(i);\");\n\nuse special tab replacing string (default is 4 spaces)\n\n    html = hl(code_string, \"<span>  </span>\");\n\nconvert code only between &lt;code&gt; blocks (leaves everything else as is) - especially useful if used together with converted [Markdown](/andris9/node-markdown) syntax that includes &lt;code&gt; blocks.\n\n    html = hl(\"<p>PHP:</p><code><?php echo 'Hello world!';?></code>\", false, true);\n\nStyles\n------\n\n**highlight** outputs HTML code with predefined CSS class names for different elements. This doesn't make a lot of sense by default (it's just a bunch of SPAN's) so you need to use a CSS file that sets the used color set for the highlighting. There's some sample CSS files in /lib/vendor/highlight.js/styles that can be used with no modification - just include one of the files in the page you are showing the highlighted code.\n\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/path/to/styles/default.css\"/>\n",
